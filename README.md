## Deep Prediction of Investor Interest: a Supervised Clustering Approach

This repo contains the accompagnying code for the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05289. Contribution is two-fold:

1. We first show the usefulness of our approach on simulated data exhibiting the characteristics awaited from our model, and compare it to a LGBM benchmark.
2. We use our approach on an open-source dataset (https://zenodo.org/record/2573031#.XaSQ9_fRY5l) to prove its usefulness on real-world data.

Deep learning code is written in **TensorFlow 2.0**.
